# AI Dev Orchestrator

A **controlled** AI software development pipeline orchestrator.

## Purpose

This project coordinates a guarded, auditable pipeline for AI-assisted software
changes. The eventual design will:

- read GitHub issues,
- enforce project workspace boundaries,
- call **internal** LiteLLM models (e.g. `minimax-m2.7`, `qwen3.6-27b`),
- apply structured file changes,
- run allowlisted checks,
- produce review packets,
- support controlled automation levels.

The emphasis is on **control and review**, not autonomous action.

## Current status: Phase 3D (mocked / dry-run CLI smoke test)

What exists today: package layout and CLI; typed project-config loading and
workspace path-policy enforcement (Phase 1); **read-only** GitHub issue
inspection that fetches one issue and parses its Markdown sections (Phase 2);
**typed LLM request/response/config models** plus an environment-driven
`LLMClientConfig` loader (Phase 3B); a **mockable, OpenAI-compatible chat
client** (`LLMClient`) that consumes those models to POST one chat completion
to an internal LiteLLM endpoint with bounded retries and typed errors
(Phase 3C); and a **CLI smoke-test command**, `llm-smoke-test`, that exercises
the Phase 3C `LLMClient` end-to-end against an in-process fake provider
(Phase 3D).

`llm-smoke-test` is **fake-provider / dry-run only**: it builds its own fake
`LLMClientConfig` and an `httpx.MockTransport` internally, reads **no**
`AIDO_LITELLM_*` (or any other) environment variables, and makes **no real
network call or real model call**. There is currently **no CLI command that
can call a real model** — no `--real`/`--live`/`--use-env` option exists
anywhere in the CLI.

The following are intentionally **not** implemented yet:

- No CLI command that calls a real model (by design — see above).
- No **GitHub writes** (read-only issue access only — no comments, labels,
  branches, or PRs).
- No agent logic.
- No file editing or command execution.
- No reads or writes of configured **target project workspaces**.
- No agent framework (LangGraph / CrewAI / AutoGen / n8n).

## Provider policy

- **No external paid AI APIs are used by default.**
- The intended **default provider is an internal LiteLLM OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint**.
- **OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot/Codex, and other external AI integrations
  are disabled by default** and are treated as **optional, future** integrations.
  They will only be usable when explicitly enabled.
- **No secrets in files.** Configure credentials via environment variables
  (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)); never commit a real `.env`.

## Install (dev)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m ai_dev_orchestrator --help
python -m ai_dev_orchestrator version
```

### Inspecting a GitHub issue (Phase 2, read-only)

```bash
python -m ai_dev_orchestrator inspect-issue --repo owner/repo --issue 1
```

Phase 2 adds **read-only** GitHub issue inspection: it fetches one issue and
reports its parsed Markdown sections (and any missing required sections). It
**does not write to GitHub**, **does not call LiteLLM**, and **does not touch
configured project workspaces**. A `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used if present
(public repos may be readable without one).

### LLM smoke test (Phase 3D, fake-provider / dry-run only)

```bash
python -m ai_dev_orchestrator llm-smoke-test
python -m ai_dev_orchestrator llm-smoke-test --model qwen3.6-27b --message "hello"
```

Phase 3D adds `llm-smoke-test`, a **dry-run smoke test** of the Phase 3C
`LLMClient`. It builds a fake `LLMClientConfig` and an `httpx.MockTransport`
in-process and sends one `LLMRequest` through the real client code path. It
**reads no environment variables**, **makes no real network call**, and
**never calls a real model** — the response is a deterministic fake generated
locally. Output states clearly that it is a dry-run, that no real model was
called, and reports the model name, response content, and token usage.

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Configuration

Per-project workspace boundaries are described by YAML files under `projects/`.
See [`projects/mis_project.yaml.example`](projects/mis_project.yaml.example) for
the expected shape. These files describe boundaries only — they contain **no
secrets**.

## Next phase

Phase 4 will add an **L1 plan generator**. It should remain offline-testable
where possible and continue to avoid agent automation, file editing, command
execution, GitHub writes, and target project workspace reads/writes unless
explicitly authorized in that phase.
